## Overview

Robo is a modern robotics framework that separates concerns between low-level hardware control and high-level coordination:

- **robot_hal**: A Rust-based framework handling real-time robotics operations including path planning, navigation, and motor control
- **telemetry**: A Go-based system managing inter-robot communication and coordination

## Features

- ü¶Ä **Rust-powered Hardware Control**
  - Real-time path planning and navigation
  - Precise motor control and signal processing
  - Sensor data integration
  - Advanced control theory implementation
  
- üîÑ **Go-based Telemetry System**
  - MQTT-based inter-robot communication
  - Real-time obstacle sharing
  - Health monitoring and diagnostics
  - Fleet-wide coordination
  
- üîí **Safety & Reliability**
  - Hardware safety guarantees through Rust
  - Robust error handling
  - Graceful degradation
  - Automatic reconnection handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable)
- Go 1.20+
- MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robo.git
cd robo

# Build the Robot HAL
cd robot_hal
cargo build --release

# Build the Telemetry System
cd ../telemetry
go build ./...
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start your MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto)
mosquitto -c /path/to/mosquitto.conf

# Run the telemetry system
cd telemetry
go run src/main.go

# In another terminal, run the robot HAL
cd robot_hal
cargo run --release
```

### Robot HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

The Robot HAL is written in Rust for its safety guarantees and real-time performance. It handles:

- Path planning and navigation
- Motor control and signal processing
- Sensor integration
- Control theory implementation
- Real-time hardware interactions

### Telemetry System

The telemetry system is written in Go for its strong networking capabilities and concurrent design. It manages:

- Inter-robot communication
- Shared obstacle detection
- Health monitoring
- Status reporting
- Fleet coordination
